# Learning Blockchain Application Development

## React, Redux, Truffle, and Material-UI Dapp

This is the _*start*_ version of the code you will be working on in the course.

This folder has the code that you'll be working on throughout the course removed. You'll need to add it as you progress through the lessons to build a fully functional Marketplace. 

If you get stuck, take a look in the _*final*_ folder, it contains a complete, working version of the application demonstrated in this course.

## Installation

1. Install node.js (version 8.9.x)

1. Install webpack globally
    ```
    npm install -g webpack
    npm install -g webpack-cli
    ```

1. Install truffle and Ganache, both available from [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/).

1. Compile and migrate the contracts.
    ```javascript
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

1. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading. For now, smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    npm start
    ```

## Docker

1. Build the docker container.
    ```
    docker build -t etherslist .
    ```

1. Launch the docker container.
    ```
    docker run -p 3000:3000 etherslist:latest
    ```

1. Browse to http://localhost:3000

## FAQ

* __Why is there both a truffle.js file and a truffle-config.js file?__

    Truffle requires the truffle.js file be named truffle-config on Windows machines. Feel free to delete the file that doesn't correspond to your platform.
